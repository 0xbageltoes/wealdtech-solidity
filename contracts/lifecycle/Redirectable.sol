 * @title Redirectable
 *        Redirectable provides a mechanism for contracts to be able to provide
 *        potential callees with the address of the contract that should be
 *        called instead of this one.  It is commonly used when a contract has
 *        been upgraded and should no longer be called.
 * 
 *        Calling setRedirect() requires the caller to have the PERM_REDIRECT
 *        permission.
 *
 *        State of this contract: under active development; has not been audited
 *        and may contain bugs and/or security holes. Use at your own risk.

 * @author Jim McDonald
 * @notice If you use this contract please consider donating some Ether or
 *         some of your ERC-20 token to wsl.wealdtech.eth to support continued
 *         development of these and future contracts
