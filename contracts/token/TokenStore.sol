/**
 * @title TokenStore
 *        TokenStore provides storage for an ERC-20 contract separate from the
 *        contract itself.  This separation of token logic and storage allows
 *        upgrades to token functionality without requiring expensive copying
 *        of the token allocation information.
 * 
 *        Calling functions that alter the token distribution require the
 *        caller to have the PERM_ACT permission.
 *
 *        Note that this contract is aggressively ERC-20 non-compliant, to
 *        avoid any confusion that this might be a token contract in its own
 *        right.
 *        
 *        Also note that this contract does not emit any events.  That is the
 *        job of the token contract.
 *        
 *        This contract has individual permissions for each major operation.
 *        These are:
 *          - PERM_MINT: permission to mint new tokens
 *          - PERM_TRANSFER: permission to transfer tokens from own holder to
 *                           another regardless of allowance
 *          - PERM_SET_ALLOWANCE: permission to set the number of tokens allowed
 *                                to be transferred from one holder to another
 *          - PERM_USE_ALLOWANCE: permission to transfer tokens from one holder
 *                                to another within the bounds of the allowance
 * @author Jim McDonald
 * @notice If you use this contract please consider donating some Ether or
 *         some of your ERC-20 token to wsl.wealdtech.eth to support continued
 *         development of these and future contracts
