/**
 * @title ENSReverseRegister
 *        ENS resolves names to addresses, and addresses to names.  But to set
 *        the resolution from address to name the transaction must come from
 *        the address in question.  This contract sets the reverse resolution as
 *        part of the contract initialisation.
 *
 *        To use this your code should inherit this contract and provide the
 *        appropriate arguments in its constructor, for example:
 *
 *            contract MyContract is ENSReverseRegister {
 *                ...
 *                MyContract(address ens) ENSReverseRegister(ens, "mycontract.eth") {
 *                    ...
 *                }
 *            }
 *
 *        Note that for this to work your contract must be given the address of
 *        the ENS registry.  If this is not supplied then this code will not run
 *        and the reverse entry will not be set in ENS (but it will not throw).
 *
 *        State of this contract: stable; development complete but the code is
 *        unaudited. and may contain bugs and/or security holes. Use at your own
 *        risk.
 *
